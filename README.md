# SEO Improvements for My Portfolio Website

## Changes Made:
I have implemented on-page SEO techniques to improve the visibility and ranking of the website. The following changes were made:

### **1. Updated Headers (H1, H2, H3)**
- Added **H1** with relevant keywords to all pages.
- Structured content with **H2 and H3** to enhance readability.
- Example: Changed **H1** on the Home page to "Full Stack Web Developer in Portobello".

### **2. Added Meta Descriptions**
- Each page now has a **meta description (140-160 characters)** including relevant keywords.
- Example for the Home page:
  ```html
  <meta name="description" content="Web Developer in Portobello - Expert in front-end and full-stack development. Contact for website solutions.">
