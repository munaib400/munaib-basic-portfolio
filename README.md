- Added informative and inviting text content with headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs for better readability.

- Added project tiles with images and links on the Projects page.
- Developed a user-friendly contact form with inputs for name, email, and message.

  - Styled contact form inputs and buttons for better UX.
  - Added responsive design improvements for smaller screens.
  - Added hover effects to navigation and social links.
- Used emojis to add friendliness and visual appeal to headings and content.
- All images used project thumbnails were sourced from public APIs and image repositories like TheMealDB.
